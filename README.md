## Problem Statement
Build a website that allows users to search for entries from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild data.

The MVP has three primary functions
- Display information and images from the Hyrule Compendium API
- Allows users to search for specific entries based on name
- Displays additional information on entries when searched
- Allows users to click on icons to see entries based on category
