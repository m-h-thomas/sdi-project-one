## Problem Statement
Build a website that allows users to search for information from the Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild API database.

The MVP has three primary functions
- Display information and images from the Hyrule Compendium API
- Allows users to search for specific entries based on name
- Displays additional information on entries when clicked on


### Example Page
